You are tasked with suggesting the most appropriate folder for a webpage based on its summary and the existing folder structure. Follow these steps carefully:

1. First, you will be presented with a summary of a webpage:

<summary>
{{ summary }}
</summary>

2. Next, you will be given the existing folder structure:

<folder_structure>
{{ formatted_structure }}
</folder_structure>

3. Analyze the webpage summary and compare it to the themes or topics represented by the existing folders. Consider the following:
- Does the content of the summary clearly match any of the existing folder themes?
- Are there key words or concepts in the summary that align with folder names?
- If no existing folder seems appropriate, suggest a new folder name that would best categorize this webpage.

4. Based on your analysis, provide your suggestion in a JSON structure with the following format:
{
    "name": "Parent Folder Name",
    "id": parent_folder_id,
    "children": [
    {
        "name": "Suggested Folder Name",
        "id": suggested_folder_id  // Optional, include only if suggesting an existing folder
    }
    ]
}

Examples:
1. Suggesting an existing folder:
{
    "name": "Development",
    "id": 2,
    "children": [
    {
        "name": "Python",
        "id": 5
    }
    ]
}

2. Suggesting a new folder:
{
    "name": "Technology",
    "id": 3,
    "children": [
    {
        "name": "Artificial Intelligence"
    }
    ]
}

5. IMPORTANT: Your response must contain ONLY the JSON structure. Do not include any explanations, justifications, or additional text.
